# Understanding-of-climate-data-manipulation-and-analysis-in-R
This report is about understanding of manipulation and analysis of climatic data in r-instat and R .
We subdivide our work in 4 main parts. Fisrt we analyse the Sadore data with R-instat. this involved ploting
some graphs, analyse descriptive statistics. The second part concern circular graph. In that part, we make
some circular graph with PICSA, some calulations and Wind rose graphs. The third part concern analysis of
time series with R. To achieve this, we will use Dodoma data and make some graphs and analysis and on the last
part we are interesting in the analysis of extreme for sadore data.
